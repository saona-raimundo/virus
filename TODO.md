## Applications

### Rate of vaccination

Discover the rate of vaccination that yields good results?

### Challenge

Possibly taking down some buildings

## Simulation

Report

- 

## GUI

Public

- nice and simple interface 
- on the website 
- for the kids to play with

- this should have the average values for 1000 simulations as you  suggested. 
  - This will take more time, as it is developing a graphical user interface for kids and I have not done that before

Privat

- export the full date for the 1000 simulations (e.g. as csv) 
- for  us to check in detail if the game behaves as we think it does
  - Is it the number of healthy people at the endo of the 10 days all we care about?
