## Reporting

- [x] List of counting tables
- [x] average matrix
- [ ] plots of process with error
  - [ ] Also for vaccinated people for an array of inputs

3 setups:

- Open
- Lock-down light: Concert halll (5, 4), restaurant (4, 3), Gym (4, 2)
- Lock-down hard: Concert halll (5, 4), restaurant (4, 3), Gym (4, 2), School (4,4), Shopping center (2,4)

## Applications

### Rate of vaccination

Discover the rate of vaccination that yields good results?

### Challenge

Possibly taking down some buildings

## Simulation

## GUI

Public

- nice and simple interface 
- on the website 
- for the kids to play with

- this should have the average values for 1000 simulations as you suggested. 
  - Rust + WebAssembly

Privat

- export the full date for the 1000 simulations (e.g. as csv) 
- for  us to check in detail if the game behaves as we think it does
